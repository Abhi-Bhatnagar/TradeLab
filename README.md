•	A site created with the intent of teaching teenagers to learn to trade through ‘paper-trading’ with simulated money and real-time stock data from yahoo finance API
•	Developed a full-stack web application with Flask serving as a backend with React/Bootstrap as the frontend
•	Effectively used Git for version control and managing push requests
•	Integrated Firebase for managing data and hosting services

#Note some developmental bugs still need to be fixed including search function only accomodating stocks and no indexs or alterantive commodities as well as scaling issues when opening on different devices.
